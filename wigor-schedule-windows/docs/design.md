# Design Document for Wigor Schedule Windows Application

## Overview
The Wigor Schedule Windows application is designed to provide users with an intuitive interface to access their schedules via the Wigor API. The application aims to streamline the process of retrieving and displaying schedule information, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components:

- **Main Application Logic (`main.py`)**: This is the entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the GUI and managing the application flow.
- **Graphical User Interface (`gui.py`)**: The GUI is built using a framework (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt), providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
- **API Client (`wigor_client.py`)**: This module handles all interactions with the Wigor API, including authentication and data retrieval.
- **Authentication (`auth.py`)**: This component manages user authentication, validating credentials and maintaining user sessions.
- **Configuration (`config.py`)**: Configuration settings, such as API endpoints and default values, are centralized in this module.
- **Data Models (`models.py`)**: This module defines the data structures used within the application, ensuring data integrity and validation.
- **Utilities (`utils.py`)**: Common utility functions are provided here to support various operations throughout the application.

## Technology Choices
- **Programming Language**: Python is chosen for its simplicity and extensive library support, making it ideal for rapid development.
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter is selected for its ease of use and integration with Python, allowing for quick prototyping of the user interface.
- **API Interaction**: The `requests` library is utilized for making HTTP requests to the Wigor API, providing a straightforward way to handle API calls and responses.
- **Testing Framework**: `pytest` is used for unit testing, ensuring that the application components are thoroughly tested and maintainable.

## Design Decisions
- **Modularity**: The application is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability. Each component has a specific responsibility, promoting separation of concerns.
- **User-Centric Design**: The GUI is designed to be intuitive, minimizing the learning curve for users. Feedback mechanisms are incorporated to enhance user experience.
- **Security Considerations**: User credentials are handled securely, with measures in place to protect sensitive information during authentication and API interactions.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Features**: Future versions may include features such as notifications for schedule changes, integration with calendar applications, and enhanced user settings.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While the initial focus is on Windows, consideration for cross-platform compatibility may be explored in future iterations.

## Conclusion
The Wigor Schedule Windows application is designed to provide a seamless experience for users accessing their schedules. With a focus on modularity, user experience, and security, the application is positioned for future growth and enhancements.
