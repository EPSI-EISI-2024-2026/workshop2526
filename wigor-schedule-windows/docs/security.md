# Security Considerations for Wigor Schedule Windows Application

## Introduction
This document outlines the security considerations for the Wigor Schedule Windows application. It addresses how the application handles user credentials, protects sensitive data, and mitigates potential security risks.

## Handling Credentials
The application supports authentication via username and cookies. It is crucial to ensure that user credentials are handled securely to prevent unauthorized access.

### Best Practices:
1. **Secure Storage**: User credentials should not be stored in plain text. Instead, consider using secure storage solutions such as Windows Credential Locker or encrypting the credentials before storage.
   
2. **Transmission Security**: Always use HTTPS for API requests to encrypt data in transit. This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **Session Management**: Implement proper session management practices. Ensure that sessions expire after a period of inactivity and provide users with the option to log out.

## Protecting User Data
User data, including schedules and personal information, must be protected against unauthorized access and breaches.

### Best Practices:
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Use strong encryption algorithms to protect user data stored in the application.

2. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to restrict access to sensitive information based on user roles.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Logging and Monitoring
Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

### Best Practices:
1. **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit logs of user activities, especially for actions that modify sensitive data. Ensure logs are stored securely and are tamper-proof.

2. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Provide generic error messages to users while logging detailed errors for internal review.

## Conclusion
By following these security considerations and best practices, the Wigor Schedule Windows application can effectively protect user credentials and sensitive data, ensuring a secure user experience. Regular security assessments and updates should be conducted to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
