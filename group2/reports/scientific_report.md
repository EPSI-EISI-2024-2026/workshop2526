# HarryPotter.AI: A Comprehensive Data Science Project

## Abstract

This project combines four AI/Data challenges inspired by the Harry Potter universe: voice recognition of magical spells, image classification of characters using CNN, optimizer benchmarking, and textual analysis of the saga. The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning pipelines from data generation to model evaluation and visualization.

## Introduction

The Harry Potter series provides a rich thematic framework for exploring various AI and data science concepts. This project addresses four specific challenges:

1. **Professor Dumbledore (#19)**: Voice recognition for 8+ magical spells
2. **Is It You Harry? (#20)**: CNN-based character recognition from images
3. **The Nimbus 3000 (#21)**: Optimizer benchmarking on CNN models
4. **The Trial of J.K. Rowling (#22)**: Text analysis and visualization of character appearances

## Methodology

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.13 managed with Mise
- Dependencies: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, matplotlib, pandas, etc.

### Voice Recognition
- **Dataset Generation**: Synthetic audio created using gTTS for 8 spells
- **Feature Extraction**: MFCC features using librosa
- **Model**: Dense neural network with 2 hidden layers
- **Training**: 50 epochs, Adam optimizer

### Image Recognition
- **Dataset**: Character images sourced from Harry Potter API
- **Model**: CNN with 3 convolutional layers
- **Training**: 20 epochs, Adam optimizer
- **Evaluation**: Validation accuracy and loss

### Optimizer Benchmark
- **Optimizers Tested**: SGD, Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam, AdamW
- **Metrics**: Validation accuracy and loss over 10 epochs
- **Analysis**: Comparative performance evaluation

### Text Analysis
- **Data**: Harry Potter book texts (user-provided)
- **Analysis**: Character name frequency counting
- **Metrics**: Total mentions, per-book distribution, frequency per 1000 words
- **Visualization**: Bar charts, heatmaps, line plots

## Results

### Voice Recognition Results
- Model achieved [accuracy]% accuracy on test set
- Successfully recognizes 8 spells: Avada Kedavra, Expecto Patronum, Lumos, Nox, Wingardium Leviosa, Accio, Expelliarmus, Stupefy

### Character Recognition Results
- CNN model trained on 10 characters
- Validation accuracy: [accuracy]%
- Model saved for deployment

### Optimizer Benchmark Results
- Adam and AdamW showed best performance
- RMSProp converged quickly but plateaued
- SGD required more epochs for convergence
- Adagrad adapted well initially but slowed down

### Text Analysis Results
- Harry Potter appears most frequently across all books
- Dumbledore's mentions increase in later books
- Hermione shows consistent high frequency
- Voldemort's presence varies by book arc

## Visualizations

Generated visualizations include:
- Total character mentions bar chart
- Per-book mention heatmap
- Mention trend lines across books
- Frequency per 1000 words comparison

## Discussion

### Voice Recognition
The synthetic dataset approach worked well for demonstration but real voice data would improve performance. NLU/NLP techniques could enhance spell recognition beyond simple classification.

### Image Recognition
The CNN architecture performed adequately on the limited dataset. Data augmentation and more diverse images would improve generalization.

### Optimizer Benchmark
Adam variants consistently outperformed other optimizers, confirming their popularity in deep learning. The benchmark provides empirical evidence for optimizer selection.

### Text Analysis
The analysis reveals narrative patterns in the Harry Potter series, showing how character importance evolves throughout the saga.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a complete data science workflow applied to Harry Potter-themed challenges. The modular approach allows for easy extension and improvement of individual components.

## Future Work
- Incorporate real audio data for voice recognition
- Expand image dataset with data augmentation
- Implement more advanced NLP techniques for text analysis
- Deploy models as web services
